        <h1>My Interest in IT</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          I love IT, the industry, and the culture I have interests in all areas of IT, from programming, networks general tech involving computers such as processors and graphics cards the latest dramas and ethical concerns.
          <br><br>

          I have been very interested in IT for a really long time but I feel my love and deep interest for IT in all of its forms was when I saved up for all of the individual parts of my computer and built it on my own, with many of my friends coming to me for computer build advise and help to build or repairing their computers which brings me a lot of joy.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p style="margin-top: 100px">
          I have a deep interest in keeping up with and learning about all forms of IT,
          Currently, I am reading ‘Permanent Record’ By Edward Snowden and I listen to many podcasts on IT and Computer Science Daily.
          <br><br>

          I really enjoy playing video games and have for many years, playing my first game when I was really young, that game as AOE2.

But these days I just love the ability and great convenience in which you can learn freely and with any information at your fingertips.
What I wish to get from this course is a stepping stone to a computer science degree, the ability to proficiently write in at least one programming language, and hopefully be able to logically transfer my knowledge of syntax and structure to pick up and learn other languages with some ease.
