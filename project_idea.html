        <h1>Project Idea: The Neighboring Eye</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 50px">
          My project idea was a simple security system upgrade, it is designed for your home security system which will significantly expand on its current capabilities.
I call it “The Neighboring Eye” it is an Artificially intelligent program which you can upload to your existing security network/surveillance system such as a ‘Swann’ system in which if you were to live in a court you could strategically place your cameras in a way where it can learn your neighbors and build encrypted profiles on who is a neighbor and who isn’t potentially preventing theft.

<br><br>

This product would be able to separate your neighbors and ping your phone or device with a snapshot of the potential criminal but would completely whitelist and ignore your neighbors.
I don’t believe I’ve ever seen or heard of a purchasable product like this I believe there are probably large scale neural networks and artificial intelligence learning models using a similar type of product, I believe the reason that this product isn’t available to the public is probably because of all the ethical issues but I believe there would be a real use for this product in keeping people safe and helping peoples anxieties eased.

<br><br>

The closest I’ve seen to this is a simple movement alarm which can be done with an inferred camera and doesn’t learn or blacklist or whitelist certain scenarios.
I feel this would be a great step in the consumer security systems sector. 
The reason i believe this product is needed and my motivation behind it is to simply keep people safe and have peoples minds put at ease wheather they are at home or at the supermarket, at work or even overseas to be able to have your own guardian 24/7 watching over your home would be an incredible feeling of relief.
This task would have many challenges before it was shipped to the public, but some easy spets to making this project sucessful would start with the format in which you can recieve this product.
Option 1: A Usb you simply plug into the hub of your surveillance system and it would do an automatic installation update.
Option 2: Online via a website where it would Continuously update your version of “The Neighboring Eye” to make sure it was working as intened. 

This product would be very Feasible i believe to find the technological skill it would be easy and to build a product that worked well would also be possible.. 
the hardest thing to do would be to get existing security camera Manufacturers on board for the Licenses to be able to load this software onto their products and secondly be able to justify the ethical reasons behind why AI And Machine Learning models could build profiles of your community.

<br><br>
If this product was to launch Successful on a large scale i believe home invasions and Robberies of Residential homes would be significantly reduced.
