        <h1>This is My Ideal Job in IT</h1>

        <h2><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=6ed2eb34cee1ac03&from=serp&vjs=3" target="_blank">Software Engineering Program Manager</a></h2>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          In this particular role, the applicant has to have technical knowledge of building applications and leading teams, this role seems like a very diverse and challenging role but rewarding the same token.
This job has aspects of the technical programming knowledge that I am still yet to achieve and a strong emphasis on leadership and project management and deeply collaborative work with other departments within the organization such as the engineering teams, Design, and Product & Research teams.
<br><br>

To be a genuine candidate for this job opportunity I would require a minimum of 5 years in a program/project management role in software development with experience in tracking software delivery processes and shipping products successfully.
I would have to be technically proficient in software development, tool, and scripting languages.
I too would have to be passionate about developing relationships which I feel i at least have that box ticked box.

        <p style="margin-top: 200px">
          In order to get these skills, I would have to complete a course in Computer Science and gain the relevant industry experience I currently lack, I too would have to become proficient in software development and learn relevant tools.
          To become fully qualified for this position I believe the way to get this role would finish be a Computer Science degree with a business management course on the side, gain relevant work experience as a software engineer and aim to lead teams and groups in the workplace to work my way up into a qualified leader with proficient technical ability.
